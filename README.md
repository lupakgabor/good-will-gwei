# Good Will Gwei

Welcome to the **Good Will Gwei** project! This is a demonstration project aimed at practicing web3 technologies. The core objective of this project is to provide a platform where users can register various charity organizations and allow users to send donations to them using the power of web3.

## Project Overview

Good Will Gwei is divided into two main parts:

### Backend

- The backend is built in a Hardhat environment, which is known for its developer-friendly features. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment that allows for easy deployment of smart contracts, running tests, and debugging. It's designed to provide developers with a seamless experience when building smart contracts for the Ethereum network.

### Frontend

- The frontend is crafted using React and Vite with Typescript. This combination ensures a modern, efficient, and easy-to-maintain codebase, with the benefits of Typescript for type safety and Vite for a fast development build tool that serves code via native ES modules, making it lightning fast.

## Implementation Goals

We have set three main goals for implementation:

1. **Standard RPC JSON Solution**: A basic approach to interact with Ethereum nodes using JSON-RPC requests. This is the foundational method for communication with a blockchain network.

2. **Using Alchemy Library**: Alchemy provides a powerful and easy-to-use abstraction over blockchain communication and interaction. With its suite of tools, it can significantly speed up development and provide a host of features out of the box.

3. **Leveraging WAGMI Library**: WAGMI is a set of React Hooks that make it a breeze to interact with web3 protocols. It simplifies the process of connecting to wallets and reading from or writing to the blockchain.
